# Sports Footwear Sales & Marketing Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **marketing- and sales-focused analytical dashboard** based on the *Sports Footwear Sales and Consumer Behavior between 2018-2026* dataset. The dashboard is designed with a clear business perspective and is divided into two main analytical layers:

1. **Descriptive analytics and business reporting** – to understand historical and current performance through the 6 years
2. **Predictive analytics and future projections** – to forecast revenue, brand performance, and demand trends for the future

The project emphasizes **decision support** for marketing and sales stakeholders by answering questions such as *which brands perform best, which channels drive revenue, and what factors influence consumer purchasing behavior*.

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Source:** Kaggle – Sports Footwear Sales and Consumer Behavior
**Time Horizon:** Multi-year dataset (historical data with future-oriented structure)

The dataset includes (but is not limited to) the following variables:

* Sales and revenue metrics
* Brands and product categories
* Sales channels (online / offline)
* Time dimensions (year, month)
* Consumer behavior attributes

⚠️ **Note:** The dataset appears to be partially simulated or aggregated. Therefore, results should be interpreted primarily for **analytical demonstration and modeling purposes**, rather than exact real-world forecasting.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Marketing Perspective

* Identify consumer purchasing patterns and preferences
* Analyze brand and product category performance
* Compare sales channels and customer behavior across channels
* Detect seasonality to support campaign timing and planning

### Sales / Business Perspective

* Analyze revenue trends and growth trajectories
* Identify top-performing and underperforming brands
* Evaluate performance across time periods and segments
* Create revenue projections to support strategic planning

## 🧩 Dashboard Structure

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Analytics Dashboard

**Key Question:** What has happened so far?

Main components:

* Total revenue and sales volume trends over time
* Revenue breakdown by brand and product category
* Online vs. offline sales contribution
* Seasonal patterns (monthly / quarterly analysis)
* Top-performing brands and products

Analytical techniques:

* Aggregations (sum, average)
* Distribution and share analysis
* Time-series visualizations

---

### 2️⃣ Predictive & Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**Key Question:** What is likely to happen next?

Main analyses:

* Revenue forecasting (short- and mid-term)
* Brand-level performance projections
* Trend and seasonality decomposition
* Scenario analysis (e.g., price or channel mix changes)

Modeling techniques:

* Time series analysis (trend, seasonality)
* Regression-based modeling
* Feature engineering (lag variables, rolling averages)

---

## 📈 Statistical & Analytical Methods

### Descriptive Statistics

* Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
* Time-series trend analysis
* Cross-category and cross-brand comparisons

### Predictive Modeling

* Time series models (trend + seasonality)
* Simple and multiple linear regression
* Model validation using train/test split

### Core Business Questions Addressed

* Which brands are expected to grow the fastest?
* What factors most strongly influence revenue and demand?
* What revenue trajectory can be expected in the upcoming periods?

## 🛠️ Suggested Technology Stack

* **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Power BI / Tableau / Plotly / Matplotlib
* **Modeling:** Scikit-learn, statsmodels
* **Dashboarding:** Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit

## 🚀 Business Value & Outcomes

The dashboard aims to:

* Support **data-driven marketing and sales decisions**
* Enable **revenue forecasting and strategic planning**
* Provide a clear, visual understanding of **brand, channel, and category performance**

The project can be easily extended with additional datasets (e.g., marketing spend, demographic data), further improving predictive accuracy and business relevance.

## 📌 Next Steps

* Data cleaning and feature engineering
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Development of the descriptive dashboard
* Implementation of predictive models
* Translation of analytical results into business insights
